# Travelling-Salesperson-Problem
Given a set of cities and distance between every pair of cities, the problem is to find the shortest possible route that visits every city exactly once and returns to the starting point. Measure the time required by Brute Force Strategy and Ant Colony Optimization to determine the shortest path possible.
The Travelling Salesman Problem is one of the best known NP-hard problems, which means that there is no exact algorithm to solve it in polynomial time. The minimal expected time to obtain optimal solution is exponential. So, for that reason, we usually use heuristics to help us to obtain a “good” solution.

Solution: Using Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm
